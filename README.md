# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-System
This is a small prototype model which can be used to check if drivers driving in the night are awake enough to safely drive. It is coded on Python and uses OpenCV, Keras and Pygame. It measures drowsiness of a person by calculating the time for which he/she closes her eyes while blinking.
